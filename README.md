# Collatz Conjecture

This repository contains programs to execute Collatz Conjecture in several languages & environments.


[![Presence on Knotters!](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Knotters&message=Project&color=12e49d&link=https://knotters.org&style=for-the-badge)](https://knotters.org)

All separate language files run separately (Ofcourse).

_All programs assume that the conjecture is true and hence rely their recursion on it. Recursion can fall in infinity if this conjecture is wrong at some number._

## Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o index.exe index.cpp && .\index
```

```bash
scriptcs index.cs
```

```bash
go run index.go
```

```bash
java index.java
```

```bash
node index.js
```

```bash
python3 index.py
```

```bash
ruby index.rb
```

```bash
cargo run index.rs
```

## Contribution

Add your own programs to this repository in other languages, with the same structure as this one. Create a new branch for your language, or complete the existing incomplete language files.
