# Collatz Conjecture

This repository contains programs to execute Collatz Conjecture in several languages & environments.

All separate language files run separately (Ofcourse).

_All programs assume that the conjecture is true and hence rely their recursion on it. If recursion can fall in infinity if this conjecture is wrong at some number._
